# ðŸŒŒ N-Body Simulation

A collection of N-Body simulation implementations exploring different computational architectures and algorithmic methods. This project compares performance and accuracy across CPU and GPU platforms, providing a learning and benchmarking resource for high-performance computing applications.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The N-Body problem simulates the motion of a system of particles under mutual gravitational influence. This repository includes several implementations with varying degrees of optimization, parallelism, and hardware utilization, enabling comparative analysis and performance study.

## ðŸŒ¿ Branches

The repository is organized into multiple branches, each containing a specific implementation:

- ðŸ§® **`naive-openmp`** â€“ Basic OpenMP implementation using the Naive method. For reference.
- ðŸš€ **`naive-cuda`** â€“ CUDA implementation using the Naive method.
- ðŸ§® **`bh-openmp`** â€“ OpenMP implementation using the Barnes-Hut method.
- ðŸš€ **`bh-cuda`** â€“ Real-time CUDA implementation using the Barnes-Hut method and OpenGL rendering.
- ðŸ§® **`fmm`** â€“ Fast multipole method
