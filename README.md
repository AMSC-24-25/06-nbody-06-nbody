# 🌌 N-Body Simulation

A collection of N-Body simulation implementations exploring different computational architectures and algorithmic methods. This project compares performance and accuracy across CPU and GPU platforms, providing a learning and benchmarking resource for high-performance computing applications.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The N-Body problem simulates the motion of a system of particles under mutual gravitational influence. This repository includes several implementations with varying degrees of optimization, parallelism, and hardware utilization, enabling comparative analysis and performance study.

## 🌿 Branches

The repository is organized into multiple branches, each containing a specific implementation:

- 🧮 **`naive-openmp`** – Basic OpenMP implementation using the Naive method. For reference.
- 🚀 **`gpu-cuda`** – CUDA implementation leveraging GPU acceleration.
- 🔁 **`gpu-opencl`** – OpenCL implementation for cross-platform GPU execution.
- 📏 **`cpu-vectorized`** – CPU SIMD-vectorized implementation using intrinsics or compiler autovectorization.
- 📊 **`visualization`** – Tool to visualize the results

*(Customize or update the branch list above according to your actual repo structure.)*
