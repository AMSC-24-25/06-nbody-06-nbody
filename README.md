# Numerical N-Body Solution
In an n-body problem, we need to find the positions and velocities of a collection of
interacting particles over a period of time.
An
n-body solver is a program that finds the solution to an n-body problem by simulating
the behavior of the particles.



## Features

- Loading initial conditions from external file
- Computing position, velocity, and total energy for each timestep
- Plot an animation of the positions of the bodies
- Plot the behaviour of energy over time


## Running Tests

The tests are found in the "tests" folder.
To run them run the following commands

```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
```

The initial conditions, found in the "initial_conditions" folder, are to be put in the "build" folder
